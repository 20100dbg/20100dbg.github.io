LoRa is a wireless communication protocol. It is designed to be power-efficient and allow long range (as its name, LOng RAnge) communications.

Like many other things in tech, a beginner in LoRa will have to browse from incomplete and outdated blog posts, to extremely detailed vendor's provided hardware specs without a single line of code.


I could put my hands on a few chips and board using LoRa: 
- LoRa HAT module (868 MHz) https://learn.sb-components.co.uk/LoRa-HAT-for-Raspberry-Pi
- Lo-Fi https://github.com/sbcshop/Lo-Fi_Software
- E32-433T30D (433 MHz) https://www.fr-ebyte.com/products/E32-433T30D/1
- Lora Wio e5 mini https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/LoRa_E5_mini/
- XIAO ESP32S3 & Wio-SX1262 https://www.seeedstudio.com/Wio-SX1262-with-XIAO-ESP32S3-p-5982.html
